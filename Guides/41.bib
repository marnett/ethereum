ABSTRACT="As multicast applications are deployed for mainstream use, the
need to secure multicast communications will become critical. Multicast,
however, does not fit the point-to-point model of most network security
protocols which were designed with unicast communications in mind. As we
will show, securing multicast (or group) communications is fundamentally
different from securing unicast (or paired) communications. In turn,
these differences can result in scalability problems for many typical
applications. In this paper, we examine and model the differences
between unicast and multicast security and then propose Iolus: a novel
framework for scalable secure multicasting. Protocols based on Iolus can
be used to achieve a variety of security objectives and may be used
either to directly secure multicast communications or to provide a
separate group key management service to other",

ABSTRACT="The Internet today provides no support for privacy or
authentication of multicast data distribution. However, an increasing
number of applications will require secure multicast services in order
to restrict group membership and enforce accountability of group
members. A major problem associated with the deployment of secure
multicast delivery services is the scalability of the key distribution
protocol. This is particularly true with regard to the handling of group
membership changes, such as member departures and/or expulsions, which
necessitate the distribution of a new session key to all the remaining
group members. In this paper, we present a new multicast key management
scheme which uses a set of auxiliary keys in order to improve
scalability. In contrast to previous schemes which generate a fixed
hierarchy of keys, we dynamically generate the most suitable key
hierarchy by composing different keys. However, our work goes one step
further by focusing on the problem of cumulative member removal. Using
Boolean function minimization techniques, our scheme outperforms all
other schemes known to us in terms of message complexity in removing
multiple group members. The efficiency of our scheme in aggregating key
updates, due to multiple member departures, offers the potential of a
significant performance advantage. The proposed scheme has been used
within a toolkit for secure Internet multicast services that we have
developed.",

ABSTRACT="One of the central problems in one-to-many wide-area
communications is forming the delivery tree -- the collection of nodes
and links that a multicast packet traverses. Significant problems remain
to be solved in the area of multicast tree formation, the problem of
scaling being paramount among these. In this paper we show how the
current IP multicast architecture scales poorly (by scale poorly, we
mean consume too much memory, bandwidth, or too many processing
resources), and subsequently present a multicast protocol based on a new
scalable architecture that is low-cost, relatively simple, and
efficient. We also show how this architecture is decoupled from (though
dependent on) unicast routing, and is therefore easy to install in an
internet that comprises multiple heterogeneous unicast routing
algorithms.",

Multicast Video Distribution",
BOOKTITLE="Proceedings of Infocom",
ADDRESS="San Fransisco",
DAY="24--28",
MONTH=mar,
YEAR=1996,
ABSTRACT="We address the problem of fairness in a feedback-controlled
multicast video distribution scheme. In a fair scheme each receiver
should receive a video stream with a quality that is commensurate with
its capabilities or the capabilities of the path leading to it,
regardless of other receivers or network paths. This fairness problem
results from the fact that multicast communication trades economy of
bandwidth with {\em granularity of control}. Distributing video using
individual feedback-controlled point-to-point streams results in high
bandwidth utilization but the granularity of control is high as
communication parameters can be negotiated individually with each
receiver. In contrast, using a single multicast stream has good
bandwidth economy, but very low granularity of control. In this paper we
propose, implement and experiment with a system that spans the spectrum
represented by the two extremes above. In the scheme, Californialled destination
set grouping (DSG), a source maintains a small number of video streams,
carrying the same video but each targeted at receivers with different
capabilities. Each stream is feedback-controlled within prescribed
limits by its group of receivers. Receivers may move among streams as
their capabilities or the capabilities of the network paths leading to
them change. The scheme is shown to improve fairness significantly at a
small bandwidth cost.",

ABSTRACT="The IP multicast delivery mechanism provides a popular basis
for delivery of continuous media to many participants in a conferencing
application.  However, the best-effort nature of multicast delivery
results in poor playback quality in the presence of network congestion
and packet loss.  Contrary to widespread belief that the real-time
nature of continuous media applications precludes the possibility of
recovery of lost packets using retransmissions, we have found that these
applications offer an interesting tradeoff between the desired playback
quality and the desired degree of interactivity.  In particular, we
propose a new model of multicast delivery called resilient multicast in
which each receiver in a multicast group can decide its own tradeoff
between reliability and real-time requirements.  To be effective, error
recovery mechanisms in such a model need to be both fast (due to the
real-time constraint) and have a low overhead (due to high volume of
continuous media data).  We have designed a resilient multicast protocol
called STORM (STructure-Oriented Resilient Multicast) in which senders
and receivers collaborate to recover from lost packets using two key
ideas.  First, group participants self-organize themselves into a
distribution structure and use the structure to recover lost packets
from adjacent nodes.  Second, the distribution structure is dynamic and
a lightweight algorithm is used to adapt the structure to changing
network traffic conditions and group membership.  We have implemented
STORM in both VAT and a packet level simulator.  Experimental results
using both the MBONE and a simulation model demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.",

ADDRESS="San Fransisco, California",
DAY="24--28",
MONTH=mar,
YEAR=1996,
ABSTRACT="This paper describes the design and implementation of a
reliable multicast transport protocol called RMTP. RMTP provides
sequenced, lossless delivery of bulk data from one sender to a group of
receivers. It allows a receiver to join or leave a group without
notifying the sender or other receivers. Protocol state maintained at
each multicast participant is independent of the number of participants.
The sender knows neither the identity of each receiver nor the number of
receivers in the multicast group. RMTP is based on a multi-level
hierarchical approach, in which the receivers are grouped into a
hierarchy of local regions, with a Designated Receiver (DR) in each
local region. Receivers in each local region periodically send
acknowledgments (ACKs) to their corresponding DR, DRs send ACKs to the
higher-level DRs, until the DRs in the highest level send ACKs to the
sender, thereby avoiding the ACK-implosion problem. DRs cache received
data and respond to retransmission requests of the receivers in their
corresponding local regions, thereby decreasing end-to-end latency. RMTP
uses a packet-based selective repeat retransmission scheme for higher
throughput. This paper also provides the measurements of RMTP's
performance with receivers located at various sites in the Internet.",

ABSTRACT="This paper describes SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast), a
reliable multicast framework for application level framing and
light-weight sessions.  The algorithms of this framework are
efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very
large sessions.  The framework has been prototyped in wb, a
distributed whiteboard application, and has been extensively tested on
a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to more than 1000
participants.  The paper describes the principles that have guided our
design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an
end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application
level framing protocol model.  As with unicast communications, the
performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the
underlying topology and operational environment.  We investigate that
dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive
algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to
adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery.  With the
adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides
good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.",

present a taxonomy of multicast scenarios on the Internet and point out
the relevant security concerns. Next we identify two major security
problems of multicast communication: \{\em individual authentication\},
and \{\em key revocation\}. Maintaining authenticity in multicast
protocols is a much more complex problem than for unicast; in
particular, known solutions are prohibitively inefficient in many cases.
We present a solution that is reasonable for a range of scenarios. Our
approach can be regarded as a `midpoint' between traditional Message
Authentication Codes and digital signatures. We also present an improved
and very efficient solution to another prevailing problem for multicast
protocols, namely the key revocation problem.",

ABSTRACT="As multicast applications are deployed for mainstream use, the
need to secure multicast communications will become critical. Multicast,
however, does not fit the point-to-point model of most network security
protocols which were designed with unicast communications in mind. As we
will show, securing multicast (or group) communications is fundamentally
different from securing unicast (or paired) communications. In turn,
these differences can result in scalability problems for many typical
applications. In this paper, we examine and model the differences
between unicast and multicast security and then propose Iolus: a novel
framework for scalable secure multicasting. Protocols based on Iolus can
be used to achieve a variety of security objectives and may be used
either to directly secure multicast communications or to provide a
separate group key management service to other",

ABSTRACT="Many emerging applications (e.g. teleconference, real-time
information services, pay per view, distributed interactive simulation,
and collaborative work ) are based upon a group communications model,
i.e., they require packet delivery from one or more authorized
receivers. As a result, securing group communications (i.e., providing
confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages delivered
between group members) will become a critical networking issue. In this
paper, we present a novel solution to the scalability problem of
group/multicast key management. We formalize the notion of a secure
group as a triple (U, K, R) where U denotes a set of users, K a set of
keys held by the users ,and R a user-key relation. We then introduce key
graphs to specify secure groups. For a special class of key graphs, we
present three strategies for securely distributing rekey messages after
a join/leave, and specify protocols for joining and leaving a secure
group. The rekeying strategies and join/leave protocols are implemented
in a prototype group key server we have built. We present measurement
results from experiments and discuss performance comparisons. We show
that our group key management service, using any of the three rekeying
strategies, is scalable to large groups with frequent joins and leaves.
In particular, the average measured processing time per join/leave
increases linearly with the logarithm of group size.",

communications is forming the delivery tree -- the collection of nodes

to be solved in the area of multicast tree formation, the problem of
scaling being paramount among these. In this paper we show how the
current IP multicast architecture scales poorly (by scale poorly, we
mean consume too much memory, bandwidth, or too many processing
resources), and subsequently present a multicast protocol based on a new
scalable architecture that is low-cost, relatively simple, and
efficient. We also show how this architecture is decoupled from (though
dependent on) unicast routing, and is therefore easy to install in an
internet that comprises multiple heterogeneous unicast routing
algorithms.",

ADDRESS="San Fransisco",
DAY="24--28",
MONTH=mar,
YEAR=1996,
ABSTRACT="We address the problem of fairness in a feedback-controlled
multicast video distribution scheme. In a fair scheme each receiver
should receive a video stream with a quality that is commensurate with
its capabilities or the capabilities of the path leading to it,
regardless of other receivers or network paths. This fairness problem
results from the fact that multicast communication trades economy of
bandwidth with {\em granularity of control}. Distributing video using
individual feedback-controlled point-to-point streams results in high
bandwidth utilization but the granularity of control is high as
communication parameters can be negotiated individually with each
receiver. In contrast, using a single multicast stream has good
bandwidth economy, but very low granularity of control. In this paper we
propose, implement and experiment with a system that spans the spectrum
represented by the two extremes above. In the scheme, Californialled destination
set grouping (DSG), a source maintains a small number of video streams,
carrying the same video but each targeted at receivers with different
capabilities. Each stream is feedback-controlled within prescribed
limits by its group of receivers. Receivers may move among streams as
their capabilities or the capabilities of the network paths leading to
them change. The scheme is shown to improve fairness significantly at a
small bandwidth cost.",

ABSTRACT="The IP multicast delivery mechanism provides a popular basis
for delivery of continuous media to many participants in a conferencing
application.  However, the best-effort nature of multicast delivery
results in poor playback quality in the presence of network congestion
and packet loss.  Contrary to widespread belief that the real-time
nature of continuous media applications precludes the possibility of
recovery of lost packets using retransmissions, we have found that these
applications offer an interesting tradeoff between the desired playback
quality and the desired degree of interactivity.  In particular, we
propose a new model of multicast delivery called resilient multicast in
which each receiver in a multicast group can decide its own tradeoff
between reliability and real-time requirements.  To be effective, error
recovery mechanisms in such a model need to be both fast (due to the
real-time constraint) and have a low overhead (due to high volume of
continuous media data).  We have designed a resilient multicast protocol
called STORM (STructure-Oriented Resilient Multicast) in which senders
and receivers collaborate to recover from lost packets using two key
ideas.  First, group participants self-organize themselves into a
distribution structure and use the structure to recover lost packets
from adjacent nodes.  Second, the distribution structure is dynamic and
a lightweight algorithm is used to adapt the structure to changing
network traffic conditions and group membership.  We have implemented
STORM in both VAT and a packet level simulator.  Experimental results
using both the MBONE and a simulation model demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.",

ABSTRACT="This paper describes the design and implementation of a
reliable multicast transport protocol called RMTP. RMTP provides
sequenced, lossless delivery of bulk data from one sender to a group of
receivers. It allows a receiver to join or leave a group without
notifying the sender or other receivers. Protocol state maintained at
each multicast participant is independent of the number of participants.
The sender knows neither the identity of each receiver nor the number of
receivers in the multicast group. RMTP is based on a multi-level
hierarchical approach, in which the receivers are grouped into a
hierarchy of local regions, with a Designated Receiver (DR) in each
local region. Receivers in each local region periodically send
acknowledgments (ACKs) to their corresponding DR, DRs send ACKs to the
higher-level DRs, until the DRs in the highest level send ACKs to the
sender, thereby avoiding the ACK-implosion problem. DRs cache received
data and respond to retransmission requests of the receivers in their
corresponding local regions, thereby decreasing end-to-end latency. RMTP
uses a packet-based selective repeat retransmission scheme for higher
throughput. This paper also provides the measurements of RMTP's
performance with receivers located at various sites in the Internet.",

ABSTRACT="This paper describes SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast), a
reliable multicast framework for application level framing and

efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very

distributed whiteboard application, and has been extensively tested on
a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to more than 1000
participants.  The paper describes the principles that have guided our
design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an
end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application
level framing protocol model.  As with unicast communications, the
performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the
underlying topology and operational environment.  We investigate that
dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive
algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to
adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery.  With the
adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides
good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.",

ABSTRACT="Multicast communication is becoming the basis for a growing
number of applications. It is therefore critical to provide founded
security mechanisms for multicast communication. Yet, existing security
protocols for multicast offer only very partial solutions. We first
present a taxonomy of multicast scenarios on the Internet and point out
the relevant security concerns. Next we identify two major security
problems of multicast communication: \{\em individual authentication\},
and \{\em key revocation\}. Maintaining authenticity in multicast
protocols is a much more complex problem than for unicast; in
particular, known solutions are prohibitively inefficient in many cases.
We present a solution that is reasonable for a range of scenarios. Our
approach can be regarded as a `midpoint' between traditional Message
Authentication Codes and digital signatures. We also present an improved
and very efficient solution to another prevailing problem for multicast
protocols, namely the key revocation problem.",

ABSTRACT="Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) is a reliable multicast
transport pro- tocol for applications that require ordered or unordered,
duplicate- free, multicast data delivery from multiple sources to
multiple receivers. PGM guarantees that a receiver in the group either
receives all data packets from transmissions and repairs, or is able to
detect unrecoverable data packet loss. PGM is specifically intended as a
work- able solution for multicast applications with basic reliability
require- ments. Its central design goal is simplicity of operation with
due regard for scalability and network efficiency.",

                 mechanisms that tailor file system resource management
                 to the needs of I/O-intensive applications. In
                 particular, we show how to use application-disclosed
                 access patterns (hints) to expose and exploit I/O
                 parallelism, and to dynamically allocate file buffers
                 among three competing demands: prefetching hinted
                 blocks, caching hinted blocks for reuse, and caching
                 recently used data for unhinted accesses. Our approach
                 estimates the impact of alternative buffer allocations
                 on application execution time and applies cost-benefit
                 analysis to allocate buffers where they will have the
                 greatest impact. We have implemented informed
                 prefetching and caching in Digitals OSF/1 operating
                 system and measured its performance on a 150 MHz Alpha
                 equipped with 15 disks running a range of applications.
                 Informed prefetching reduces the execution time of text
                 search, scientific visualization, relational database
                 queries, speech recognition, and object linking by
                 20-83\%. Informed caching reduces the execution time of
                 computational physics by up to 42\% and contributes to
                 the performance improvement of the object linker and
                 the database. Moreover, applied to multiprogrammed,
                 I/O-intensive workloads, informed prefetching and
                 caching increase overall throughput.",
  comment =      "See patterson:informed-tr for an earlier version.
                 Programs may give hints to the file system about what
                 they will read in the future, and in what order. Hints
                 are used for informed prefetching and informed caching.
                 Most interesting thing about this paper over the
                 earlier ones is the buffer management. Prefetcher and
                 demand fetcher both want buffers. LRU cache and hinted
                 cache both could supply buffers (thru replacement).
                 Each supplies a cost for giving up buffers and benefit
                 for getting more buffers. These are expressed in a
                 common 'currency', in terms of their expected effect on
                 I/O service time, and a manager takes buffers from one
                 and gives buffers to another when the benefits outweigh
                 the costs. All is based on a simple model, which is
                 further simplified in their implementation within
                 OSF/1. Performance looks good, they can keep more disks
                 busy in a parallel file system. Furthermore, informed
                 caching helps reduce the number of I/Os. Indeed they
                 'discover' MRU replacement policy automatically.",

                 and prefetching to reduce file read latencies by
                 exploiting application level hints about future I/O
                 accesses. We argue that systems that disclose
                 high-level knowledge can transfer optimization
                 information across module boundaries in a manner
                 consistent with sound software engineering principles.
                 Such Transparent Informed Prefetching (TIP) systems
                 provide a technique for converting the high through put
                 of new technologies such as disk arrays and
                 log-structured file systems into low latency for
                 applications. Our preliminary experiments show that
                 even without a high-throughput I/O sub system TIP
                 yields reduced execution time of up to 30% for
                 applications obtaining data from a remote file server
                 and up to 13% for applications obtaining data from a
                 single local disk. These experiments indicate that
                 greater performance benefits will be available when TIP
                 is integrated with low level resource management

ABSTRACT="The sharing of caches among Web proxies is an important
technique to reduce Web traffic and alleviate network bottlenecks.
Nevertheless it is not widely deployed due to the overhead of existing
protocols. In this paper we propose a new protocol called ''Summary
Cache''; each proxy keeps a summary of the URLs of cached documents of
each participating proxy and checks these summaries for potential hits
before sending any queries. Two factors contribute to the low overhead:
the summaries are updated only periodically, and the summary
representations are economical -- as low as 8 bits per entry. Using
trace-driven simulations and a prototype implementation, we show that
compared to the existing Internet Cache Protocol (ICP), Summary Cache
reduces the number of inter-cache messages by a factor of 25 to 60,
reduces the bandwidth consumption by over 50%, and eliminates between
30% to 95% of the CPU overhead, while at the same time maintaining
almost the same hit ratio as ICP. Hence Summary Cache enables cache
sharing among a large number of proxies.",

ABSTRACT="The IDMaps project aims at providing a distance map of the
Internet from which the relative distances between points on the
Internet can be gauged \cite{FJPZGJ99}. Distance map is a service that
many distributed systems and applications can benefit; for example, a
common method to improve user perceived performance of the Internet is
to place data and server mirrors closer to the clients. When a client
tries to access a mirrored server, which mirror should it access? With
IDMaps, the closest mirror can be determined based on distance estimates
between the client and the mirrors. In this paper we investigate both
graph theoretic methods and {\em ad hoc} heuristics for instrumenting
the Internet to obtain distance maps. We evaluate the efficacy of the
resulting distance maps by comparing the determinations of closest
replica using known topology against those obtained from the distance
maps.",

ABSTRACT="There is an increasing need for Internet hosts to be able to
quickly and efficiently learn the distance, in terms of metrics such as
latency or bandwidth, between Internet hosts. For example, to select the
nearest of multiple equal-content web servers. This paper explores
technical issues related to the creation of a public infrastructure
service to provide such information. In so doing, we suggests an
architecture, called IDMaps, whereby Internet distance information is
distributed over the Internet, using IP multicast groups, in the form of
a virtual distance map. Systems listening to the groups can estimate the
distance between any pair of IP addresses by running a spanning tree
algorithm over the received distance map. We also presents the results
of experiments that give preliminary evidence supporting the
architecture. This work thus lays the initial foundation for future work
in this new area.",

ABSTRACT="There is an increasing number of Internet applications that
attempt to optimize their network communication by considering the
network distance across which data is transferred. Such applications
range from replication management to mobile agent applications. One
major problem of these applications is to efficiently acquire distance
information for large computer networks. This paper presents an approach
to create a global view on the Internet, a so-called network distance
map, which realizes a hierarchical decomposition of the network into
regions and which allows to estimate the network distance between any
two hosts. This view is not only a single snapshot but is dynamically
adapted to the continuously changing network conditions. The main idea
is to use a certain set of hosts for performing distance measurements
and to use the so gained information for estimating the distance between
arbitrary hosts. A hierarchical clustering provides the notion of
regions and allows to coordinate the measurements in such a way that the
resulting network load is minimized. An experimental evaluation on the
basis of 119 globally distributed measurement servers shows that already
a small number of measurement servers allows to construct fairly
accurate distance maps at low costs.",

                 is a system for evaulating trust. It is essentially a

                 <ActionString> is a string constructed by the

                 strings as input and returns a boolean status (filters
                 may also append annotations to the action strings).
                 Assertions are either local (called policies, and

                 utilization than young segments; the cost/benefit
                 heuristic works significantly better. The intuition is
                 that old data is unlikely to die soon, so we might just
                 as well reclaim the free space associated with it now
                 and use it, instead of waiting for a long time until
                 utilization falls below the threshold of the greedy
                 heuristic. The file system maintains a segment usage
                 table to have data for this heuristic. The paper also
                 presents empirical data showing that the Sprite LFS is
                 much faster than SunOS FFS on small files, and that the
                 cleaning behaviour on real workloads is even better
                 than in the simulations they presented earlier. One
                 interesting statement was that the Sprite LFS is not
                 more complex than FFS: it needs log handling and the
                 cleaner, but can skip complex block allocation
                 algorithms and fsck.",

                 that provides good performance because it allows us to
                 trade disk accesses for network communication. Harp is
                 intended to be used within a file service in a
                 distributed network; in our current implementation, it
                 is accessed via NFS. Preliminary performance results

ABSTRACT="The IDMaps project aims at providing a distance map of the
Internet from which the relative distances between points on the
Internet can be gauged \cite{FJPZGJ99}. Distance map is a service that
many distributed systems and applications can benefit; for example, a
common method to improve user perceived performance of the Internet is
to place data and server mirrors closer to the clients. When a client
tries to access a mirrored server, which mirror should it access? With
IDMaps, the closest mirror can be determined based on distance estimates
between the client and the mirrors. In this paper we investigate both
graph theoretic methods and {\em ad hoc} heuristics for instrumenting
the Internet to obtain distance maps. We evaluate the efficacy of the
resulting distance maps by comparing the determinations of closest
replica using known topology against those obtained from the distance
maps.",

ABSTRACT="There is an increasing need for Internet hosts to be able to
quickly and efficiently learn the distance, in terms of metrics such as
latency or bandwidth, between Internet hosts. For example, to select the
nearest of multiple equal-content web servers. This paper explores
technical issues related to the creation of a public infrastructure
service to provide such information. In so doing, we suggests an
architecture, called IDMaps, whereby Internet distance information is
distributed over the Internet, using IP multicast groups, in the form of
a virtual distance map. Systems listening to the groups can estimate the
distance between any pair of IP addresses by running a spanning tree
algorithm over the received distance map. We also presents the results
of experiments that give preliminary evidence supporting the
architecture. This work thus lays the initial foundation for future work
in this new area.",

ABSTRACT="There is an increasing number of Internet applications that
attempt to optimize their network communication by considering the
network distance across which data is transferred. Such applications
range from replication management to mobile agent applications. One
major problem of these applications is to efficiently acquire distance
information for large computer networks. This paper presents an approach
to create a global view on the Internet, a so-called network distance
map, which realizes a hierarchical decomposition of the network into
regions and which allows to estimate the network distance between any
two hosts. This view is not only a single snapshot but is dynamically
adapted to the continuously changing network conditions. The main idea
is to use a certain set of hosts for performing distance measurements
and to use the so gained information for estimating the distance between
arbitrary hosts. A hierarchical clustering provides the notion of
regions and allows to coordinate the measurements in such a way that the
resulting network load is minimized. An experimental evaluation on the
basis of 119 globally distributed measurement servers shows that already
a small number of measurement servers allows to construct fairly
accurate distance maps at low costs.",

ABSTRACT="Layered Video Multicast with Retransmissions (LVMR) is a
system for distributing video using layered coding over the Internet,
The two key contributions of the system are: (1) improving the quality
of reception within each layer by retransmitting lost packets given an
upper bound on recovery time and applying an adaptive playback point
scheme to help achieve more successful retransmission, and (2) adapting
to network congestion and heterogeneity using hierarchical rate control
mechanism. This paper concentrates on the rate control aspects of LVMR.
In contrast to the existing sender-based and receiver-based rate control
in which the entire information about network congestion is either
available at the sender (in sender-based approach) or replicated at the
receivers (in receiver-based approach), the hierarchical rate control
mechanism distributes the information between the sender, receivers, and
some agents in the network in such a way that each entity maintains only
the information relevant to itself. In addition to that, the
hierarchical approach enables intelligent decisions to be made in terms
of conducting concurrent experiments and choosing one of several
possible experiments at any instant of time based on minimal state
information at the agents in the network. Protocol details are presented
in the paper together with experimental and simulation results to back
our claims.",

ABSTRACT="Real-Time reliable multicast over a best-effort service
network remains a challenging research problem. Most protocols for
reliable multicast use repair techniques that result in significant
and variable delay, which can lead to missed deadlines in real-time
scenarios. In this paper we present a repair technique that combines
forward error correction (FEC) with automatic repeat request (ARQ).
The novel aspect of the technique is its ability to reduce delay in
reliable multicast delivery by sending repairs proactively (i.e.,
before they are required). The technique requires minimal state at
senders and receivers, and no additional active router functionality
beyond what is required by the current multicast service model.
Furthermore, the technique uses only end-to-end mechanisms, where all
data and repairs are transmitted by the data-originating source,
leaving receivers free from any burden of sending repairs. We simulate
a simple round-based version of a protocol embodying this technique to
show its effectiveness in preventing repair request implosion, reducing
the expected time of reliable delivery of data, and keeping bandwidth
usage for repairs low. We show how a protocol using the technique can
be adapted to provide delivery that is reliable before a real-time
deadline with probability extremely close to one. Finally, we develop
several variations of the protocol that use the technique in various
fashions for high rate data streaming applications, and present
results from additional simulations that examine performance in a
variety of Internet-like heterogeneous networks.",

ABSTRACT="Current Internet congestion control protocols operate
independently on a per-flow basis.  Recent work has demonstrated that
cooperative congestion control strategies between flows can improve
performance for a variety of applications, ranging from aggregated TCP
transmissions to multiple-sender multicast applications.  However, in
order for this cooperation to be effective, one must first identify the
flows that are congested at the same set of resources.  In this paper,
we present techniques based on loss or delay observations at end-hosts
to infer whether or not two flows experiencing congestion are congested
at the same network resources.  We validate these techniques via
queueing analysis, simulation, and experimentation within the
Internet.",

ABSTRACT="Replication is a commonly proposed solution to problems of
scale associated with distributed services. However, when a service is
replicated, each client must be assigned a server. Prior work has
generally assumed that assignment to be static. In contrast, we propose
dynamic server selection, and show that enables application-level
congestion avoidance. Using tools to measure available bandwidth and
round trip latency (RTT), we demonstrate dynamic server selection and
compare it to previous static approaches. We show that because of the
variability of paths in the Internet, dynamic server selection
consistently outperforms static policies, reducing response times by as
much as 50%. However, we also must adopt a systems perspective and
consider the impact of the measurement method on the network. Therefore,
we look at alternative low-cost approximations and find that the careful
measurements provided by our tools can be closely approximated by much
lighter-weight measurements. We propose a protocol using this method
which is limited to at most a 1% increase in network traffic but which
often costs much less in practice.",
