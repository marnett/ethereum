# Smart Contract Examples
This repository contains contract examples with a wide range of difficulty:
If pyethereum is installed (see main repository) simply run `python [filename].py` from `\Examples` directory in terminal

`easy_bank.py` - an introductory contract implementing a simple send_currency function

`namecoin.py` - beginner contract that implements a simple altcoin

`new_bank.contract.py` - a moderate bank contract implementing deposit, withdraw, and transfer functions

`version1.py` - a moderate rock paper scissor example. More practice with functions and parameter passing

`version3.py` - an advanced contract (refer to the smart contract guide for complete explanation). Implements state machine, commitment scheme, and secures against several blockchain vulnerabilities
